# OrderVora Product Improvement Log

Version: 1.0

## Purpose

This document is the official Product Improvement Log for the OrderVora project.

Its purpose is to record Product, UI, UX, naming, copywriting, interaction, and polish improvements discovered during development reviews without interrupting active feature implementation.

Improvements are collected during Task reviews and are implemented later during the dedicated Sprint Polish phase.

## Working Rules

1. Review every completed Task before moving to the next Task.
2. Record newly discovered improvements in this file.
3. Do not interrupt active development to implement polish items unless an issue is critical or blocking.
4. Keep every improvement ID permanent.
5. Organize entries by Sprint and Task.
6. Existing entries must not be removed or overwritten unless explicitly requested.
7. New entries should be appended to the relevant Sprint and Task section.
8. All Pending items for a Sprint are reviewed and implemented together during that Sprint's Final Polish phase.
9. Future product ideas that are not part of the active Sprint belong in the Future Ideas (Backlog) section.

# Sprint 20A — OrderVora AI Website Studio

## Task 1 — Foundation Review

### IMP-001 — Rename Current Website to Your Storefront

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Product naming / UX copy
- **Current:** `Current Website`
- **Change to:** `Your Storefront`
- **Reason:** More customer-focused, gives a stronger sense of ownership, and better fits OrderVora's storefront-first product language.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-002 — Rename Website Health to Store Health

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Product naming
- **Current:** `Website Health`
- **Change to:** `Store Health`
- **Reason:** OrderVora is evolving toward a Business Operating System rather than only a website builder.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-003 — Add a Premium AI Website Studio Hero

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Product experience / visual hierarchy
- **Description:** Add a premium hero section at the top of the page.
- **Suggested copy:**
  - `OrderVora AI Website Studio`
  - `Build, customize and launch your storefront with AI.`
- **Suggested primary action:** `Generate New Brand Concepts`

### IMP-005 — Improve AI Brand Concept Names and Descriptions

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Product experience / AI presentation
- **Description:** Replace generic concept numbering with premium concept names and clear positioning descriptions.
- **Example directions:**
  - `Minimal Modern` — clean, premium, contemporary.

### IMP-006 — Replace Fix Now with Positive Action Language

- **Priority:** High
- **Type:** UX copy
- **Current:** `Fix Now`
- **Preferred alternatives:** `Optimize` or `Apply`

- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-007 — Rename Website Analytics to Store Insights

- **Priority:** High
- **Type:** Product naming
- **Current:** `Website Analytics`
- **Change to:** `Store Insights`
- **Reason:** Broader and more intelligent positioning than traditional analytics terminology.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-008 — Add Store Setup Progress Card

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Onboarding / activation UX
- **Description:** Add a progress card near the top of AI Website Studio showing setup completion percentage and checklist progress.
- **Example checklist:**
  - Website Created
  - Brand Selected
  - Publish Website
  - Connect Custom Domain
  - Enable Loyalty
  - Launch Marketing
- **Reason:** Gives the customer a clear path to completion and creates motivation to finish setup.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-009 — Improve Typography, Spacing, and Visual Hierarchy

- **Priority:** High
- **Type:** Visual polish
- **Description:** Improve typography hierarchy, whitespace, card spacing, content grouping, and visual rhythm across the page.
- **Direction:** Premium, calm, modern, and editorial rather than crowded or dashboard-heavy.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-010 — Improve Micro-Interactions and Transitions

- **Priority:** High
- **Type:** Interaction polish
- **Description:** Improve hover states, press states, transitions, loading feedback, card interactions, and subtle motion.
- **Reason:** The experience should feel polished and premium without unnecessary animation.
- **Status:** Pending

## Task 2 — AI Brand Concepts Review

### IMP-011 — Replace Thumbnail-Like Concept Previews with Realistic Device Presentation

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Product presentation / preview UX
- **Description:** Ensure every AI Brand Concept is presented inside a realistic mobile device frame rather than as a thumbnail-like screenshot.
- **Requirement:** Each device frame should contain a storefront preview area that feels like a real phone screen, not an attached image artifact.
- **Reason:** The customer should immediately understand that they are previewing a real mobile storefront experience.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-012 — Make Phone Preview Match the Real Published Storefront

- **Priority:** Critical
- **Type:** Product integrity / preview accuracy
- **Description:** The phone preview should render the same real component tree, content structure, styling rules, and behavior that will be used by the published storefront.
- **Reason:** Avoid divergence between the preview experience and the live site after publishing.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-013 — Add Light and Dark Appearance Preview Controls

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Type:** Brand preview enhancement
- **Description:** Add a simple appearance toggle inside Brand Concept preview so customers can review supported light and dark presentation modes where the selected concept supports both.
- **Reason:** Helps customers evaluate the identity across different visual environments without regenerating the concept.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-014 — Add Device Preview Selector

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Type:** Responsive preview UX
- **Description:** Add a device selector for previewing supported storefront layouts across mobile device families.
- **Suggested options:**
  - iPhone
  - Android

- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-015 — Add Brand Concept Evaluation Scores

- **Priority:** High
- **Type:** Decision support / AI explanation
- **Description:** Add a concise evaluation panel to each Brand Concept to help the customer understand the strengths of each option.
- **Suggested metrics:**
  - Conversion Potential
  - Luxury Feel
  - Modern Feel
  - Mobile Experience
- **Reason:** Helps customers compare concepts based on business goals instead of choosing only by appearance.
- **Status:** Pending

## Task 6 — AI Content Generation Engine Review

### IMP-016 — Surface a Business-Type Override in the AI Content Panel

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Type:** Personalization / AI input control
- **Description:** The content engine already keys its prompts and CTA choices off the restaurant's real Business Type (set once during onboarding), but the owner has no way to see or change that value from inside the AI Content panel itself.
- **Suggested addition:** Show the detected business type in the panel ("Generating for: Vape Shop") with a link to Restaurant Settings to change it.
- **Reason:** Right now a wrong or outdated business type silently produces mismatched CTA/copy with no visible explanation — surfacing it closes that gap without adding new business logic.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-017 — Explain the "template" Provider Label

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Type:** Trust / AI transparency
- **Description:** Version History shows either a real provider name (e.g. "openai") or "template" when generation fell back to deterministic copy, but doesn't explain the difference.
- **Suggested addition:** A short tooltip or inline note on "template" entries: "Generated from a smart template — AI service was unavailable."
- **Reason:** An owner comparing two history entries shouldn't have to guess why one says "openai" and another says "template."
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-018 — Before/After Preview on Regenerate

- **Priority:** Low
- **Type:** Confidence / undo clarity
- **Description:** Regenerating a section replaces its content immediately (recoverable via Undo or Version History), but the owner doesn't see what changed until after committing.
- **Suggested addition:** A lightweight side-by-side or diff preview before applying a regeneration, at least for the higher-stakes "Generate Website Content" (scope FULL) action.
- **Reason:** Reduces hesitation around a full-site regeneration, especially once an owner has already hand-edited several sections.
- **Status:** Pending

### IMP-019 — Group Version History by Generation Batch

- **Priority:** Low
- **Type:** Information architecture
- **Description:** A single "Generate Website Content" click creates one history row per sub-scope internally is stored as one FULL entry today, but once an owner also regenerates individual sections, the flat list can get long.
- **Suggested addition:** Collapse/group consecutive entries from the same session, or add simple date-based section headers.
- **Reason:** Keeps Version History scannable as it grows past a handful of entries.
- **Status:** Pending

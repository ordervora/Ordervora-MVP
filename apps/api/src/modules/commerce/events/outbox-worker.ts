/**
 * Drains a batch of unprocessed OutboxEvent rows, dispatching each to the
 * in-process commerceEventBus and marking it processedAt on success (Sprint
 * 07.7 H-11). This is the durable path in front of the bus's own
 * process-local EventEmitter — it changes how reliably an event reaches the
 * bus, not the bus's own public interface.
 *
 * Delivery is at-least-once, not exactly-once: a crash between dispatch and
 * marking processedAt would redeliver on the next poll. Any real subscriber
 * built on top of this must be idempotent, consistent with this codebase's
 * existing idempotency-key discipline elsewhere.
 *
 * Multi-instance-safe as of Production Hardening Phase 6: the claiming
 * SELECT below uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` inside a transaction, so
 * concurrently-polling instances each lock a disjoint set of rows instead
 * of racing over the same ones — a second instance's identical query
 * simply skips whatever this one already has locked and claims the next
 * available rows instead. The lock is held for the entire transaction,
 * spanning the dispatch loop below, not just the SELECT itself: releasing
 * it early (e.g. by committing right after the SELECT, in a separate
 * transaction from the dispatch+update) would let a second instance
 * re-claim and double-dispatch the same row while this one is still
 * processing it. This is safe to hold open across the loop specifically
 * because commerceEventBus.emit() is synchronous and fire-and-forget
 * (event-bus.ts) — the transaction is never left open across real I/O.
